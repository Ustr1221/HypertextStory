                <b>My Computer Science Journey: Setting my Major</b> <br> In my junior year of high school, I was doing Running Start, and on my first day at community college, <br> I met with my advisor and she asked me what I wanted to major in. I couldn't think of any subject that <br> I was particularly intrested in and after a while I just said computer science. I didn't know much about <br> computer science besides it being about making websites, games, and it making alot of money. During <br> my time at Running Start, I only took 3 coding classes, which were; "intro to programing", "Java 1", <br> and "Java 2". I did not really enjoy the first coding class since we really did not code, but it wasn't <br> until Java1 that I realized that I liked coding. I would spend hours coding, testing, debugging, and <br> freaking out when my code doesnt work. Then when I finally fix my code and it works as intended,<br> the feeling of acomplishment made me realize that coding was fun. <br>
