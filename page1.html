                <b>My Computer Science Journey: First Time Seeing HTML</b> <br> In middle school, I got my first school laptop and one of my friends showed me <br> how to change webpages for myself using the 'inspect' feature. I played around <br> with it by doing little things like changing the google logo to something else, <br> or pranking my younger brother into thinking I was in a video with his favorite <br> youtuber. I also used it to change my grade when showing it to my parents <br> in the middle of quarters since my grades were not that good until the end of <br> the quarter when I turn in every late assignment in the final week.
